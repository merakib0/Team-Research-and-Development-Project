Using the cleaned sample of apartments, we ran Spearman’s rank correlation between listed price in US dollars and apartment living area in square metres. The result was a positive correlation of about 0.64 with a p-value smaller than 0.001. Because this p-value is well below 0.05, we treat the result as strong evidence that, in this dataset, larger apartments generally have higher asking prices.
