The GitHub log shown in Appendix B reflects steady progress throughout the project rather than a rush of work at the end. It includes meaningful updates to R scripts, data cleaning, and report drafting from different team members. Overall, the log shows that tasks were shared fairly and that GitHub helped us collaborate effectively.
Three example significant commits you can report (adjust the messages to match your real log):

Commit Message: Initial data import and cleaning script
 Impact: This commit introduced our first reproducible R workflow for loading the real-estate dataset, dealing with missing values, and creating the cleaned subset that all later analysis relied on.


Commit Message: Add visualisations and Spearman correlation analysis
 Impact: It added the code for scatterplots and histograms, ran the Spearman correlation test, and saved the outputs that support the analysis in Sections 3 and 4 of the report.


Commit Message: Integrate revised Introduction and Background sections
 Impact: This merge updated Sections 1 and 2, ensuring the research question, hypotheses and literature review were aligned with the final analysis, improving the clarity and flow of the report.
