Recent research continues to emphasise that the size of a dwelling is closely tied to housing prices, although the relationship is often more complex than a simple linear increase. Feng et al. (2021) show, using data from a specialised housing zone in Taiwan, that smaller units experience diminishing price gains as they grow, while larger homes may rise in value at a faster rate. Duan et al. (2021) analyse the Beijing metropolitan region and find that the influence of floor area, as well as other physical features such as building age and bedroom count, differs across neighbourhoods. In some high-priced central districts, the effect of these characteristics can even weaken or reverse.
Further work by Chen et al. (2025) highlights the continued importance of housing size in urban Beijing, demonstrating through machine-learning methods that floor area remains one of the strongest predictors of price once location factors are considered. Wan et al. (2025), studying the Baltimore region, report similar findings: building area plays a major role in shaping predicted prices within their nonlinear neural-network model.
Overall, these studies agree that size is a central determinant of housing value, though its impact varies considerably across different markets and spatial contexts.
