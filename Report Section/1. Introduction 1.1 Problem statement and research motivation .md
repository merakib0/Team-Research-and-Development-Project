Housing markets play a big role in shaping household wealth, financial stability, and people’s ability to find affordable homes. In many countries, property prices have risen much faster than wages, meaning that a typical home now costs several times the average yearly income. As a result, affordability has continued to decline (Igan, 2024; Doroszczyk, 2024).Research in real-estate economics, especially hedonic price models, shows that property prices reflect many features at the same time, including floor area, number of rooms, building quality and location. This study uses a large international apartment dataset to explore how living space relates to listed prices, using correlation analysis to measure the strength of this association.
