Housing markets affect how much wealth households can build, how stable the financial system is, and whether people can find homes they can afford. In many countries, house prices have grown faster than wages, so typical homes now cost several times the average annual income and affordability has worsened(Igan, 2024; Doroszczyk, 2024). Research in real-estate economics, especially hedonic price models, shows that property prices reflect many features at the same time, including floor area, number of rooms, building quality and location. This study uses a large international apartment dataset to explore how living space relates to listed prices, using correlation analysis to measure the strength of this association.
