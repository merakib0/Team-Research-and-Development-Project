Even though the project ran smoothly, there are still things we could improve. At the beginning, we should have explored the dataset more thoroughly, including testing extra variables or considering different research questions before choosing the final one. Our GitHub documentation—such as issues and commit messages, could also be clearer so that our decisions are easier to follow. Lastly, practising more advanced plotting and reporting tools in R earlier would have helped us present our findings more effectively.
