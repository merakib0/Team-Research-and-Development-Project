Using a 5% significance level, the Spearman rank correlation test gives very strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which states that there is no relationship between apartment living area and listed price. The test produced a correlation of around 0.63, and R reported the p-value as p < 2.2e-16 — far below the 0.05 threshold. This means we reject H0 and conclude that a positive correlation exists in the full set of listings. In practical terms, larger apartments in this dataset tend to have higher asking prices, though other factors like location, age and building quality also play a role.
