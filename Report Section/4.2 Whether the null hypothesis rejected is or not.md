At the 5% significance level, the Spearman rank correlation test provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, which states that apartment living area and listed price are unrelated. The test returned a correlation of about 0.63, and R reported a p-value of p < 2.2e-16, which is far below 0.05. This allows us to confidently reject H0 and conclude that there is a positive correlation across the full dataset. In practical terms, larger apartments in this dataset tend to have higher asking prices, though other factors like location, age and building quality also play a role.
