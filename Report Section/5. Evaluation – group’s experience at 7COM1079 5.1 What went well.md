Our group worked smoothly throughout the module. We settled on a clear research question early and split the tasks across data cleaning, analysis, and writing. Regular online meetings helped us keep track of progress, spot issues with the correlation assumptions, and sort them out before they developed into bigger problems. Using GitHub also made collaboration smoother by letting us organise our code, prevent conflicts, and track all updates easily.
