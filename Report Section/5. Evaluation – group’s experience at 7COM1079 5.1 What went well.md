Our group worked smoothly throughout the module. We agreed on a clear research question early on and divided the work between data cleaning, analysis, and writing. We held regular online meetings, which helped us review each other’s progress, notice problems with the correlation assumptions, and fix them before they caused bigger issues. Using GitHub also made the process easier, as it helped us manage our code, avoid clashes, and keep track of all changes.
