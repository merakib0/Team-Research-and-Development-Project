While previous studies consistently recognise living area as an important factor in housing prices, they are limited to individual regions and rely on local sales data, making it unclear whether their findings extend to a broader international market. Most also use complex hedonic or machine-learning models, which means they seldom report a simple correlation between size and price. This project instead draws on a large dataset of apartment listings from 27 countries.
Is there a correlation between apartment living area (square metres) and listed price (USD) in the international real-estate dataset used in this study?
Answering this provides a clear baseline before exploring more advanced modelling approaches.
