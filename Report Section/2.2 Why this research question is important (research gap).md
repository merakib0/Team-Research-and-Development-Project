Although previous studies consistently identify living areas as an important driver of housing prices, most are based on data from specific regions and local housing markets. This makes it uncertain whether their conclusions apply more widely across different countries or an international context. Most also use complex hedonic or machine-learning models, which means they seldom report a simple correlation between size and price. In contrast, this project uses a large dataset of apartment listings from 27 different countries.
Our main question, Is whether there is a correlation between apartment living area (in square metres) and listed price (in USD) across this international dataset?
Answering this gives us a clear starting point before moving on to more advanced modelling techniques.
