The analysis uses the publicly available world_real_estate_data(147k).csv dataset hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains 147,536 apartment listings from 27 countries, with variables describing location, building characteristics, internal layout, floor areas and listed price in US dollars. The key variables in this study are apartment_living_area (internal living space in square metres) and price_in_USD (asking price). After restricting the data to listings where both variables are present, 27,192 apartments remain for correlation analysis.
