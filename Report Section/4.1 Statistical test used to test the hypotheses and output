Since our research question focused on the relationship between two continuous variables—apartment living area and listed price—a correlation test was suitable. We initially tried Pearson’s correlation, but both variables were heavily right-skewed and contained outliers, meaning the assumptions were not satisfied. Because of this, we switched to Spearman’s rank correlation, which is more reliable for skewed data. Using 27,198 apartment records, we found a moderate-strong positive relationship (rho ≈ 0.63, p < 0.001).
