Overall, we consider the project a success. We developed a suitable correlation-focused research question, carried out the right data cleaning steps, and applied appropriate statistical methods in R. Our visualisations and explanations were clear, and the work strengthened our understanding of real-estate data, including issues like skewness, outliers, and checking assumptions before selecting tests.
