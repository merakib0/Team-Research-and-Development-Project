Recent studies continue to show that the size of a home is strongly linked to its price, although the pattern is not always a straightforward one. Feng et al. (2021), using data from a specialised housing area in Taiwan, found that smaller units gain value more slowly as they increase in size, while larger homes tend to rise in price at a quicker rate. Duan et al. (2021) analyse the Beijing metropolitan region and find that the influence of floor area, as well as other physical features such as building age and bedroom count, differs across neighbourhoods. In some high-priced central districts, the effect of these characteristics can even weaken or reverse.
Chen et al. (2025) also emphasise the importance of housing size in urban Beijing. Using machine-learning models, they show that floor area remains one of the strongest predictors of price even after accounting for location. Wan et al. (2025) report similar results in their study of the Baltimore area, where building size is a key factor influencing predicted prices in their nonlinear neural-network model.
Overall, these studies show a consistent pattern: the size of a home is a major factor in determining its value, but the strength of this effect can differ widely between markets and locations.
