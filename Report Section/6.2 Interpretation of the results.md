The results answer our research question by showing a clear positive correlation between apartment living area and listed price in the dataset. For the population of listings studied, larger flats usually sell for more, so extra space appears to carry real value. This supports the wider housing literature that treats dwelling size as a key driver of prices, although our findings do not prove causation or apply automatically to every housing market.
