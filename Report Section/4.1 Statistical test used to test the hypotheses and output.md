Since our research question focused on the relationship between two continuous variables which are apartment living area and listed price, a correlation test was suitable. We first tested the relationship using Pearson’s correlation, but the strong right skew and presence of outliers meant its assumptions were not met. For this reason, we switched to Spearman’s rank correlation, which handles skewed data more effectively. Based on 27,198 apartment listings, we found a moderate-to-strong positive relationship (rho ≈ 0.63, p < 0.001).
